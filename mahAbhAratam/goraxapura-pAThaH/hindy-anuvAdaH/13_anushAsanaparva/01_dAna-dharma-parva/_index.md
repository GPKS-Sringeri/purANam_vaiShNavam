First 22 chapters of anushasana parva were added to the text after 13th century. Because even the Andhra mahabharatam doesn't know about these chapters. Even Arjuna Mishra mentions that most of the manuscripts verified by him in the 15th century did not have these chapters. kshemendra refers to these chapters in his abridgement though. Hence, given the saiva nature (eg. [014](/purANam_vaiShNavam/mahAbhAratam/goraxapura-pAThaH/hindy-anuvAdaH/13_anushAsanaparva/01_dAna-dharma-parva/014_meghavAhanaparvAkhyAne) and it being found only in Kashmir back then), it is to be considered as a later interpolation of some KP guy.

Could be that they are akhyanas which were added to the mbh text later

Yardi has tried to assign the chapters to five different eras/authors based on the average number of long syllable letters in anushtup verses.. as per him, these 22 chapters are part of first authors work.. his method made sense to me before I noted something.. as per him, Anu Gita was written before Bhagavad Gita.. that is absolutely nonsensical. And it also doesn't explain these chapters, if part of original, failed to appear in most of the manuscripts even in 15th century. So I had to throw that methodology out of the window.
