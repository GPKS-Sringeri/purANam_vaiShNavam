This false dichotomy between #BhagavadGita and #Smritis get repeated again and again, most of the times in pro-Hindu publications, which try to use Gita as a club to undermine Smritis. If Gita has final word on everything as is often portrayed, why then does Gita 16.24 says "Shastras are your authority as regards to what is to be done & what not to be done?" Why is Gita referring to some other Shastras to be final word regarding matters related to Dharma? And how do the Hindu Acharyas understand this reference to 'Shastras'?

- Sri Ramanujacharya says Shastra refers to Veda, Dharmashastra, Itihasa, and Purana.
  - Sri Vedantadeshikacharya Venkatanatha says Shastra refers to Veda, Smriti, and Sadachara.
- Sri Sridhara Swami says Shastra refers to Veda, Smriti, Purana, etc.
- Swami Sivananda says Shastra refers to Vedas and Smritis.
- Sri Madhusudhana Saraswati says Shastra refers to Veda, Smriti, Purana, etc.

However, every text has its own scope and applicability. Gita is a part of Prashtana Trayi of Vedanta. but on matters of Dharma, the text itself refers to other Shastras to be consulted.
